However, finding and downloading 3D clipart models can be challenging, especially if you are looking for free or low-cost options. Some websites may offer 3D clipart models as torrents, which are files that contain information about other files that can be downloaded from multiple sources. Torrents can be risky, as they may contain viruses, malware, or illegal content.
 
Fortunately, there is a safer and easier way to download and use Vectric Aspire 3D clipart models. Vectric has its own online store called Design & Make, where you can browse and purchase CNC-ready clipart models that work perfectly with Vectric Aspire software[^1^]. Design & Make offers single models, model projects, or project collections, giving you tons of versatility and options to customize your projects.
 
To download and use Vectric Aspire 3D clipart models from Design & Make, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Create a free Design & Make account on their website[^1^]. This will allow you to access any free content released by Design & Make, as well as any content you purchase from them.
2. Log in to your Design & Make account and browse the store for the 3D clipart models you want. You can filter by category, theme, price, or popularity. You can also preview the models for free before purchasing them.
3. Once you find the models you want, add them to your cart and proceed to checkout. You can pay with PayPal or credit card. After completing your purchase, you will be able to download the models immediately from your Design & Make account.
4. The models will be downloaded as .zip files containing various file formats, such as .v3m, .stl, .rlf, and .png. The .v3m file format is the most compatible with Vectric Aspire software, as it contains both the 3D geometry and the texture information of the model.
5. Extract the .zip files to a folder on your computer. Then, open Vectric Aspire software and create a new project or open an existing one. To import the 3D clipart models into your project, go to File > Import > Import Component / 3D Model. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the .zip files and select the .v3m file of the model you want to import. Click Open.
6. The 3D clipart model will appear on your project workspace. You can resize, rotate, move, or combine it with other models or vectors as you wish. You can also adjust the material settings, toolpaths, and preview options to suit your needs.
7. When you are happy with your project, you can save it as a .crv3d file or export it as a .stl file for machining on your CNC router.
