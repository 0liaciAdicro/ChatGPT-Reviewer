# Reverb Classics: A Review of the Native RC 48 Reverb Plugin
 
If you are looking for a high-quality reverb plugin that can emulate the sound of legendary studio hall reverbs, you might want to check out the Native RC 48 Reverb Classics by Native Instruments. This plugin is designed in cooperation with Softube, a renowned Swedish company that specializes in software emulations of professional audio hardware. The RC 48 is inspired by one of the most coveted reverb units in history, which has been used on countless game, TV, and film soundtracks and gold and platinum hit records.
 
The RC 48 consists of two algorithms: Random Hall and Hall. Both algorithms offer six intuitive sliders that control the same parameters: Pre Delay, Size, Density, Diffusion, Spread, and Effect. The Random Hall algorithm features Spin and Wander controls for creating random movement with incredibly lively and natural tails. The Hall algorithm offers a more classic and smooth sound with a rich harmonic character. The plugin also has a gorgeous visual display that lets you see the shape and intensity of the reverb's acoustic footprint, for real-time visual feedback and easy adjustments.

This display effectively visualizes the shape and depth of the reverb, as well as the decay of the reverb tail.

This gives you a great sense of control and feedback over your sound, and helps you to fine-tune your reverb settings to suit your mix.

You can choose from presets such as Bright Hall, Dark Hall, Drum Room, Vocal Plate, Guitar Ambience, and many more. You can also create your own presets and save them for later use.
